### Background (Sampson vs. HeartWise Health Systems Corporation (2023))

As society becomes increasingly intertwined with AI in 2025, hospitals strive to use AI/ML models to provide state-of-the-art care to their patients. Hospitals have many tools to choose from, and lives are at stake when hospitals make a decision. There unfortuantely isn't much accountability when an AI company makes a claim versus how the model actually performs, and this has led to some serious issues. Most notably, **Sampson v. HeartWise Health Systems Corporation (2023)** is the case regarding 29 year old Joshua Sampson. He went to Isaac Health for cardiac screening, where they used HeartWise Health Systems Corporation's AI screening software which didn't detect any problems with Joshua's heart. A few weeks later, Joshua died from arrhythmia, and the court found not HeartWise Health Systems Corporation which developed the model, but Isaac Health, liable for a wrongful death action. It also turned out that the model was trained and upheld accuracy claims for those above 50 years ago, which wasn't clear to Isaac Health at the time. 

Thus, EigenHealth comes in to increase the transparency between hospitals and the biotech companies building these AI models. 


### What is EigenHealth?

EigenHealth is an application for hospitals and clinic to get reliable benchmarks on biotech companies that offer AI Models. We use AVS as a service (using Othentic stack) to help validate that a healthcare model is as accurate as it claims, as well as verifying more nuanced details on which groups the AI model performs stronger on. The hospital simply puts in the AI model and the benchmark test, and once the results are validated through the AVS, the hospital can analyze its performance against other models on our leaderboard and make a more informed decision. 

Additionally, we also have a page for stakers who want to delegate their tokens to operators to help further secure the network (using P2P API). 


### What is the future of EigenHealth?

We are both interested in continuing to build EigenHealth, as we believe this is a strong use case that has an impact on everyone who recieves care from a hospital. 

1) One of our big visions is **web3 abstraction** for the hospitals. Hospitals pay a subscription fee in USD, and under the hood that fee is used for staking rewards for the operators powering the AVS that secures our system. In other words, the way EigenHealth calculates benchmark results for AI models is abstracted away from the hospitals, but they can be assured that these results are accurate and secure as they are leveraged from the underlying AVS system.

2) We would also like to offer more flexibility in benchmarks results of a given model. For example, hospitals should also be able to group model performance into buckets such as gender and age. This is because may hospitals/clincs specialize on patients of a certain age/other factors, so this feature will help further personalize models to hospitals.
